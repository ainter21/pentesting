# Lesson 4

## Five stages of hacking

1. Reconnaissance: information gathering, without attemping scan on servers
   1. Passive
   2. Active
2. Scanning and enumeration: port scan. Bettter enumeration, better access. Most important lessons.
3. Gaining access: found a way in.
4. Maintain access: not been detected, preventing reboot etc...
5. Covering tracks

## Passive Recon

### Physical/Local recon. 

Location information:
- staellite drones
- drone recon
- building layout
Job information
- Employees
- Pictures (social networks, computer photos, etc)

### Web/Host

- Target validation: the ip space and the host.
- Finding Subdomains: find more info about the sites.
- Fingerprinting: what type of backend they are using.
- Data Breaches: check if there are credentials that have been cracked from the domain.

### Tools and applications

Always check if the site is on the bug bounty program

- bugcrowd
- hunter.io: find emails
- google dorks
-  theHarvester
-  haveIbeenPwned
-  bluto: use have i been pwned info for do something
   -  if it does not install with `pip install bluto`, you have to chec `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Bluto/modules/data_mine.py`
   -  `import olefile`, plain
-  crt.sh: used to find subdomains and certificate information

## Fingerprinting

- weppalyzer
- whatweb: `-v tesla.com`
- builtwith
